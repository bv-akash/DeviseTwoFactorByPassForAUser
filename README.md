# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This is a Project based on Ruby 2.1 & rails 5.2.0 . In this rails Project I have used Devise Gem to
Create a simple login System which is a Two Factor Authentication Based login Module, which is done
by using the Rails Gem 'devise-two-factor'. Also this project Enables the user to Opt for Not
having an 2FA OTP if they desire to do so, even after the 2FA is Enabled in their system.
